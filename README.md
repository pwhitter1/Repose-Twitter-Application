Adapted from online tutorial: 

"Twitbot" uses Twitter’s API to grab tweets that include keywords that indicate dispiritedness and automatically “tweets at” the user words of comfort. 

"Twitstreaming" contains a separate program that converts the tweets into a human readable format and saves them in a text file.
